WP Grade Comments makes it easy for instructors who use WordPress in a course setting to give private feedback and/or grades to post authors, all without leaving the familiar commenting interface.

== Description ==

When reading posts while logged in as an Administrator, the comment reply form will contain two additional checkboxes:

1. "Make this comment private" - When checked, only site Administrators and the author of the current post will be able to see the comment. Threaded to private comments, whether left by an admin or by the post author, are always private as well.
1. "Add a grade" - When checked, a Grade field will appear. Grades can appear in private or public comments, while the grade itself will always be private (visible only to the Administrator and the post author). Grades are also visible to administrators as a new column in Dashboard > Posts.

This plugin was developed for the [https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu](City Tech Open Lab).
